# cm-callsign
 
Welcome to CM-Callsign! 

This resource is intended to allow the end user to change the callsign on the roof of their police vehicle in FiveM. All vehicles must support a callsign system. Currently this script only supports the Project Sloth Livery V2 pack. If you want other packs to work with it, please create an issue on this script's Github issue tab. 

How does it work?

Do /setcallsign DIGIT1 DIGIT2 DIGIT3 and tada! Your callsign will be on the roof of your car. Make sure to add spaces between each number or it WILL NOT work. Only numbers are supported, not letters.

Whats Next?

I plan to add support for future car packs that allow you to change the colour of the callsign via a command, but current the Project Sloth cars do not support changing callsign colours.
