# cm-callsign
 
Welcome to CM-Callsign! 

This resource is intended to allow the end user to change the callsign on the roof of their police vehicle in FiveM. All vehicles must support a callsign system. 

Currently this script supports the Project Sloth Livery V2 pack & all CarLabs cars. If you want other packs to work with it, please create an issue on this script's Github issue tab. 

How does it work?

Do /setcallsign DIGIT1 DIGIT2 DIGIT3 and tada! Your callsign will be on the roof of your car. Make sure to add spaces between each number or it WILL NOT work. Only numbers are supported, not letters.

--CarLabs Exclusive Features--

Use /setcallsigncolor COLOR(Lowercase Only) to change the callsign to one of six predefined colors. Only black, white, red, yellow, pink and blue are supported.

If you enter an invalid color, you have the option of chat vs QBNotify notifications telling you the pre-defined colors. You can change this in the config.lua file.
